# Logistic-Regression

In this project, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.
Start with "ex2.mlx" file.
Files needed for this project - 

1. ex2.mlx - MATLAB Live Script that steps you through the exercise
2. ex2data1.txt - Training set for the first half of the exercise
3. ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise
4. mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features
5. plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classifier's decision boundary
6. *plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
7. *sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function
8. *costFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function
9. *predict.m - Logistic regression prediction function
10. *costFunctionReg.m - Regularized logistic regression cost function
